# Sum to N Function Implementations

Welcome! This repository showcases three different JavaScript implementations to calculate the summation of all integers from 1 up to `n`. These solutions highlight various approaches and coding styles, demonstrating my ability to tackle problems using loops, formulas, and recursion.

## Implementations

1. **sum_to_n_a**: Uses a `for` loop to iteratively add numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. **sum_to_n_b**: Employs the arithmetic series formula for a quick, mathematical approach.
3. **sum_to_n_c**: Utilizes a recursive function to achieve the summation in a more functional style.

## Why These Implementations?

- **Diverse Techniques**: Each function reflects a different problem-solving strategy, emphasizing flexibility in thinking.
- **Efficiency**: From iterative to mathematical, each method offers unique efficiency characteristics.
- **Scalability**: Shows readiness to adapt solutions based on requirements, whether it's simplicity, speed, or elegance.

## Getting Started

To see these functions in action:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the JavaScript file in your favorite editor or console.
3. Test each function with various values of `n` to explore their behaviors.

## Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these solutions and discuss any improvements or alternative approaches. Looking forward to contributing my coding skills to the team!
